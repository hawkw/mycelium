//! Cells storing a value which must be initialized prior to use.
//!
//! This module provides:
//!
//! - [`InitOnce`]: a cell storing a [`MaybeUninit`] value which must be
//!       manually initialized prior to use.
//! - [`Lazy`]: an [`InitOnce`] cell coupled with an initializer function. The
//!       [`Lazy`] cell ensures the initializer is called to initialize the
//!       value the first time it is accessed.
