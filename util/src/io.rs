//! A modified version of the Rust standard library's `std::io` module, suitable
//! for use in Mycelium and other kernels.
//!
//! The traits and functions here are mostly identical to (and copied from!) the
//! standard library's `std::io` module, with the following differences:
//!
//! - `Read::read_to_end` and `Read::read_to_string` require the "alloc" feature
//!   flag on `mycelium_util` (which is enabled by default). Bootloaders & other
//!   code which cannot allocate may disable this feature flag.
//! - `Read::read_vectored` and `Write::write_vectored` do not exist.
//! - Most of the `BufRead` utility functions (`lines`, `split`, `read_until`)
//!   require the "alloc" feature
//! - `BufReader` and `BufWriter` require the "alloc" feature (and are not yet implemented).
//! - The `io::Error` type takes an `ErrorKind` and an optional `&'static str`,
//!   and does not wrap another error. This is because we need to be able to
//!   construct I/O errors even when we cannot allocate.
