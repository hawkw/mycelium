## overview

This crate is a collection of general-purpose utility types and traits for use
in the [Mycelium] operating system and its related libraries.

> **Warning**
> This crate is not *really* intended for general public consumption &mdash;
> it's written specifically for use in [`Mycelium`]. While it can be used
> elsewhere, it may have a number of Mycelium-specific quirks and design
> decisions. It's being published to crates.io primarily so that other crates
> which depend on it can be published, not because it's expected to be broadly
> useful outside of Mycelium.
>
> Also, because this crate exists primarily for use in Mycelium, breaking
> changes may be released frequently, and previous major versions will generally
> not be supported.
