  # disable incremental compilation.
  #
  # incremental compilation is useful as part of an edit-build-test-edit cycle,
  # as it lets the compiler avoid recompiling code that hasn't changed. however,
  # on CI, we're not making small edits; we're almost always building the entire
  # project from scratch. thus, incremental compilation on CI actually
  # introduces *additional* overhead to support making future builds
  # faster...but no future builds will ever occur in any given CI environment.
  #
  # see https://matklad.github.io/2021/09/04/fast-rust-builds.html#ci-workflow
  # for details.

  # run host tests
  #
  # many crates in mycelium have tests that run on the host platform and are
  # compiled with the host's target triple. this allows the tests to use the
  # Rust standard library, enabling the use of testing libraries like `proptest`
  # and `loom`.
  #
  # it's also faster to run these tests without building a kernel image and
  # spinning up a QEMU VM, so host tests are preferred for tests that doesn't
  # *need* to be tested in a mycelium VM.
