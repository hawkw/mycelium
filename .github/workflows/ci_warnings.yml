env:
  # disable incremental compilation.
  #
  # incremental compilation is useful as part of an edit-build-test-edit cycle,
  # as it lets the compiler avoid recompiling code that hasn't changed. however,
  # on CI, we're not making small edits; we're almost always building the entire
  # project from scratch. thus, incremental compilation on CI actually
  # introduces *additional* overhead to support making future builds
  # faster...but no future builds will ever occur in any given CI environment.
  #
  # see https://matklad.github.io/2021/09/04/fast-rust-builds.html#ci-workflow
  # for details.
  CARGO_INCREMENTAL: 0
  # allow more retries for network requests in cargo (downloading crates) and
  # rustup (installing toolchains). this should help to reduce flaky CI failures
  # from transient network timeouts or other issues.
  CARGO_NET_RETRY: 10
  RUSTUP_MAX_RETRIES: 10
  # don't emit giant backtraces in the CI logs.
  RUST_BACKTRACE: short

jobs:

  # check whether we can build mycelium on the *latest* Rust nightly.
  #
  # the actual build is run on a pinned nightly revision in the `rust-toolchain`
  # file. this job checks to see if we can build mycelium on whatever the most
  # recent nightly is. if this fails, there are breaking changes we need to
  # address before updating to a newer nightly build.
