# NOTE! As a workaround for https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/97708,
# maitake uses some `no_mangle` functions. This will cause linker errors if
# you attempt to use two versions of maitake in the same binary. Until then,
# we use the "links" key to prevent two versions of maitake in the same
# dependency graph
