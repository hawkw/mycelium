/// An asynchronous [mutual exclusion lock][mutex] for protecting shared data.
///
/// The data can only be accessed through the [RAII guards] returned
/// from [`lock`] and [`try_lock`], which guarantees that the data is only ever
/// accessed when the mutex is locked.
///
/// # Comparison With Other Mutices
///
/// This is an *asynchronous* mutex. When the shared data is locked, the
/// [`lock`] method will wait by causing the current [task] to yield until the
/// shared data is available. This is in contrast to *blocking* mutices, such as
/// [`std::sync::Mutex`], which wait by blocking the current thread[^1], or
/// *spinlock* based mutices, such as [`mycelium_util::sync::spin::Mutex`],
/// which wait by spinning in a busy loop.
///
/// The [`futures-util`] crate also provides an implementation of an asynchronous
/// mutex, [`futures_util::lock::Mutex`]. However, this mutex requires the Rust
/// standard library, and is thus unsuitable for use in environments where the
/// standard library is unavailable. In addition, the `futures-util` mutex
/// requires an additional allocation for every task that is waiting to acquire
/// the lock, while `maitake`'s mutex is based on an [intrusive linked list],
/// and therefore can be used without allocation[^2]. This makes `maitake`'s
/// mutex suitable for environments where heap allocations must be minimized or
/// cannot be used at all.
///
/// In addition, this is a [fairly queued] mutex. This means that the lock is
/// always acquired in a first-in, first-out order &mdash; if a task acquires
/// and then releases the lock, and then wishes to acquire the lock again, it
/// will not acquire the lock until every other task ahead of it in the queue
/// has had a chance to lock the shared data. Again, this is in contrast to
/// [`std::sync::Mutex`], where fairness depends on the underlying OS' locking
/// primitives; and [`mycelium_util::sync::spin::Mutex`] and
/// [`futures_util::lock::Mutex`], which will never guarantee fairness.
///
/// Finally, this mutex does not implement [poisoning][^3], unlike
/// [`std::sync::Mutex`].
///
/// [^1]: And therefore require an operating system to manage threading.
///
/// [^2]: The [tasks][crate::task::Task] themselves must, of course, be stored
///     somewhere, but this need not be a heap allocation in systems with a
///     fixed set of  statically-allocated tasks. And, when tasks *are*
///     heap-allocated, these  allocations [need not be provided by
///     `liballoc`][storage].
///
/// [^3]: In fact, this mutex _cannot_ implement poisoning, as poisoning
///     requires support for unwinding, and [`maitake` assumes that panics are
///     invariably fatal][no-unwinding].
