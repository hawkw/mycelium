/// An asynchronous [readers-writer lock].
///
/// This type of lock protects shared data by allowing either multiple
/// concurrent readers (shared access), or a single writer (exclusive access) at
/// a given point in time. If the shared data must be modified, write access
/// must be acquired, preventing other threads from accessing the data while it
/// is being written, but multiple threads can read the shared data when it is
/// not being mutated.
///
/// This is in contrast to a [`Mutex`], which only ever allows a single
/// core/thread to access the shared data at any point in time. In some cases,
/// such as when a large number of readers need to access the shared data
/// without modifying it, using a `RwLock` can be more efficient than a
/// [`Mutex`].
///
/// # Usage
///
/// The type parameter `T` represents the data that this lock protects. It is
/// required that `T` satisfies [`Send`] to be shared across threads and
/// [`Sync`] to allow concurrent access through readers. The RAII guards
/// returned from the locking methods implement [`Deref`] (and [`DerefMut`]
/// for the `write` methods) to allow access to the content of the lock.
///
/// The [`read`] method acquires read access to the lock, returning a
/// [`RwLockReadGuard`]. If the lock is currently locked for write access, the
/// [`read`] method will wait until the write access completes before allowing
/// read access to the locked data.
///
/// The [`write`] method acquires write access to the lock, returning a
/// [`RwLockWriteGuard`], which implements [`DerefMut`]. If the lock is
/// currently locked for reading *or* writing, the [`write`] method will wait
/// until all current reads or the current write completes before allowing write
/// access to the locked data.
///
/// # Priority Policy
///
/// The priority policy of this lock is _fair_ (or [_write-preferring_]), in
/// order to ensure that readers cannot starve  writers. Fairness is ensured
/// using a first-in, first-out queue for the tasks awaiting the lock; if a task
/// that wishes to acquire the write lock is at the head of the queue, read
/// locks will not be given out until the write lock has  been released. This is
/// in contrast to the Rust standard library's [`std::sync::RwLock`], where the
/// priority policy is dependent on the operating system's implementation.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use maitake::sync::RwLock;
///
/// async fn example() {
///     let lock = RwLock::new(5);
///
///     // many reader locks can be held at once
///     {
///         let r1 = lock.read().await;
///         let r2 = lock.read().await;
///         assert_eq!(*r1, 5);
///         assert_eq!(*r2, 5);
///     } // read locks are dropped at this point
///
///     // only one write lock may be held, however
///     {
///         let mut w = lock.write().await;
///         *w += 1;
///         assert_eq!(*w, 6);
///     } // write lock is dropped here
/// }
