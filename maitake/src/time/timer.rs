/// A `Timer` tracks the current time, and notifies [`Sleep`] and [`Timeout`]
/// [future]s when they complete.
///
/// This timer implementation uses a [hierarchical timer wheel][wheel] to track
/// large numbers of `Sleep` futures efficiently.
///
/// # Creating Futures
///
/// A `Timer` instance is necessary to create [`Sleep`] and [`Timeout`] futures.
/// Once a [`Sleep`] or [`Timeout`] future is created by a `Timer`, they are
/// *bound* to that `Timer` instance, and will be woken by the `Timer` once it
/// advances past the deadline for that future.
///
/// The [`Timer::sleep`] and [`Timer::timeout`] methods create [`Sleep`] and
/// [`Timeout`] futures, respectively. In addition, fallible
/// [`Timer::try_sleep`] and [`Timer::try_timeout`] methods are available, which
/// do not panic on invalid durations. These methods may be used in systems
/// where panicking must be avoided.
///
/// ### Setting a Global Timer
///
/// In addition to creating [`Sleep`] and [`Timeout`] futures using methods on a
/// `Timer` instance, a timer may also be set as a [global default timer]. This
/// allows the use of the free functions [`sleep`], [`timeout`],
/// [`try_sleep`], and [`try_timeout`], which do not require a reference to a
/// `Timer` to be passed in. See [the documentation on global timers][global]
/// for details.
///
/// # Driving Timers
///
/// &#x26a0;&#xfe0f; *A timer wheel at rest will remain at rest unless acted
/// upon by an outside force!*
///
/// Since `maitake` is intended for bare-metal platforms without an operating
/// system, a `Timer` instance cannot automatically advance time. Instead, the
/// operating system's run loop must periodically call the [`Timer::turn`]
/// method, which advances the timer wheel to the current time and wakes any
/// futures whose timers have completed.
///
/// The [`Timer::turn`] method may be called on a periodic interrupt, or on
/// every iteration of a system run loop. If the system is also using the
/// [`maitake::scheduler`](crate::scheduler) module, calling [`Timer::turn`]
/// after a call to [`Scheduler::tick`] is generally appropriate.
///
/// # Clocks
///
/// In addition to driving the timer, user code must also provide a [`Clock`]
/// when constructing a [`Timer`]. The [`Clock`] is a representation of a
/// hardware time source used to determine the current timestamp. See the
/// [`Clock`] type's documentation for details on implementing clocks.
///
/// ## Hardware Time Sources
///
/// Depending on the hardware platform, a time source may be a timer interrupt
/// that fires on a known interval[^1], or a timestamp that's read by reading
/// from a special register[^2], a memory-mapped IO location, or by executing a
/// special instruction[^3]. A combination of multiple time sources can also be
/// used.
///
/// [^1]: Such as the [8253 PIT interrupt] on most x86 systems.
///
/// [^2]: Such as the [`CCNT` register] on ARMv7.
///
/// [^3]: Such as the [`rdtsc` instruction] on x86_64.
///
/// ### Periodic and One-Shot Timer Interrupts
///
/// Generally, hardware timer interrupts operate in one of two modes: _periodic_
/// timers, which fire on a regular interval, and _one-shot_ timers, where the
/// timer counts down to a particular time, fires the interrupt, and then stops
/// until it is reset by software. Depending on the particular hardware
/// platform, one or both of these timer modes may be available.
///
/// Using a periodic timer with the `maitake` timer wheel is quite simple:
/// construct the timer wheel with the minimum [granularity](#timer-granularity)
/// set to the period of the timer interrupt, and call [`Timer::try_turn`] every
/// time the periodic interrupt occurs.
///
/// However, if the hardware platform provides a way to put the processor in a
/// low-power state while waiting for an interrupt, it may be desirable to
/// instead use a one-shot timer mode. When a timer wheel is advanced, it
/// returns a [`Turn`] structure describing what happened while advancing the
/// wheel. Among other things, this includes [the duration until the next
/// scheduled timer expires](Turn::time_to_next_deadline). If the timer is
/// advanced when the system has no other work to perform, and no new work was
/// scheduled as a result of advancing the timer wheel to the current time, the
/// system can then instruct the one-shot timer to fire in
/// [`Turn::time_to_next_deadline`], and put the processor in a low-power state
/// to wait for that interrupt. This allows the system to idle more efficiently
/// than if it was woken repeatedly by a periodic timer interrupt.
///
/// ### Timestamp-Driven Timers
///
/// When the timer is advanced by reading from a time source, the
/// [`Timer::turn`] method should be called periodically as part of a runtime
/// loop (as discussed in he previous section), such as every time [the
/// scheduler is ticked][`Scheduler::tick`]. Advancing the timer more frequently
/// will result in [`Sleep`] futures firing with a higher resolution, while less
/// frequent calls to [`Timer::turn`] will result in more noise in when [`Sleep`]
/// futures actually complete.
///
/// ## Timer Granularity
///
/// Within the timer wheel, the duration of a [`Sleep`] future is represented as
/// a number of abstract "timer ticks". The actual duration in real life time
/// that's represented by a number of ticks depends on the timer's _granularity.
///
/// When constructing `Timer` (e.g. by calling [`Timer::new`]), the minimum
/// granularity of the timer is determined by the [`Clock`]'s `tick_duration`
/// value. The selected tick duration influences both the resolution of the
/// timer (i.e. the minimum difference in duration between two `Sleep` futures
/// that can be distinguished by the timer), and the maximum duration that can
/// be represented by a `Sleep` future (which is limited by the size of a 64-bit
/// integer).
///
/// A longer tick duration will allow represented longer sleeps, as the maximum
/// allowable sleep is the timer's granularity multiplied by [`u64::MAX`]. A
/// shorter tick duration will allow for more precise sleeps at the expense of
/// reducing the maximum allowed sleep.
