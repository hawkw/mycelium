/// A `Timer` tracks the current time, and notifies [`Sleep`] and [`Timeout`]
/// [future]s when they complete.
///
/// This timer implementation uses a [hierarchical timer wheel][wheel] to track
/// large numbers of `Sleep` futures efficiently.
///
/// # Creating Futures
///
/// A `Timer` instance is necessary to create [`Sleep`] and [`Timeout`] futures.
/// Once a [`Sleep`] or [`Timeout`] future is created by a `Timer`, they are
/// *bound* to that `Timer` instance, and will be woken by the `Timer` once it
/// advances past the deadline for that future.
///
/// The [`Timer::sleep`] and [`Timer::timeout`] methods create [`Sleep`] and
/// [`Timeout`] futures, respectively. In addition, fallible
/// [`Timer::try_sleep`] and [`Timer::try_timeout`] methods are available, which
/// do not panic on invalid durations. These methods may be used in systems
/// where panicking must be avoided.
///
/// ### Setting a Global Timer
///
/// In addition to creating [`Sleep`] and [`Timeout`] futures using methods on a
/// `Timer` instance, a timer may also be set as a [global default timer]. This
/// allows the use of the free functions [`sleep`], [`timeout`],
/// [`try_sleep`], and [`try_timeout`], which do not require a reference to a
/// `Timer` to be passed in. See [the documentation on global timers][global]
/// for details.
///
/// # Driving Timers
///
/// &#x26a0;&#xfe0f; *A timer wheel at rest will remain at rest unless acted
/// upon by an outside force!*
///
/// Since `maitake` is intended for bare-metal platforms without an operating
/// system, a `Timer` instance cannot automatically advance time. Instead, it
/// must be driven by a *time source*, which calls the [`Timer::advance`] method
/// and/or the [`Timer::pend_duration`] and [`Timer::force_advance`] methods.
///
/// Depending on the hardware platform, a time source may be a timer interrupt
/// that fires on a known interval[^1], or a timestamp that's read by reading
/// from a special register[^2], a memory-mapped IO location, or by executing a
/// special instruction[^3]. A combination of multiple time sources can also be
/// used.
///
/// In any case, the timer must be advanced periodically by the time source.
///
/// [^1]: Such as the [8253 PIT interrupt] on most x86 systems.
///
/// [^2]: Such as the [`CCNT` register] on ARMv7.
///
/// [^3]: Such as the [`rdtsc` instruction] on x86_64.
///
/// ### Interrupt-Driven Timers
///
/// When the timer is interrupt-driven, the interrupt handler for the timer
/// interrupt should call either the [`Timer::pend_duration`] or
/// [`Timer::advance`] methods.
///
/// [`Timer::advance`] will attempt to optimistically acquire a spinlock, and
/// advance the timer if it is acquired, or add to the pending tick counter if
/// the timer wheel is currently locked. Therefore, it is safe to call in an
/// interrupt handler, as it and cannot cause a deadlock.
///
/// However, if interrupt handlers must be extremely short, the
/// [`Timer::pend_duration`] method can be used, instead. This method will
/// *never* acquire a lock, and does not actually turn the timer wheel. Instead,
/// it always performs only a single atomic add. If the time source is an
/// interrupt handler which calls [`Timer::pend_duration`], though, the timer
/// wheel must be turned externally. This can be done by calling the
/// [`Timer::force_advance_ticks`] method periodically outside of the interrupt
/// handler, with a duration of 0 ticks. In general, this should be done as some
/// form of runtime bookkeeping action. For example, the timer can be advanced
/// in a system's run loop every time the [`Scheduler::tick`] method completes.
///
/// ### Timestamp-Driven Timers
///
/// When the timer is advanced by reading from a time source, the
/// [`Timer::advance`] method should generally be used to drive the timer. Prior
/// to calling [`Timer::advance`], the time source is read to determine the
/// duration that has elapsed since the last time [`Timer::advance`] was called,
/// and that duration is provided when calling `advance`.
///
/// This should occur periodically as part of a runtime loop (as discussed in
/// the previous section), such as every time [the scheduler is
/// ticked][`Scheduler::tick`]. Advancing the timer more frequently will result
/// in [`Sleep`] futures firing with a higher resolution, while less frequent
/// calls to [`Timer::advance`] will result in more noise in when [`Sleep`]
/// futures actually complete.
///
/// # Timer Granularity
///
/// Within the timer wheel, the duration of a [`Sleep`] future is represented as
/// a number of abstract "timer ticks". The actual duration in real life time
/// that's represented by a number of ticks depends on the timer's _granularity.
///
/// When constructing a `Timer` (e.g. by calling [`Timer::new`]), the minimum
/// granularity of the timer is selected by providing the [`Duration`]
/// represented by a single timer tick. The selected tick duration influences
/// both the resolution of the timer (i.e. the minimum difference in duration
/// between two `Sleep` futures that can be distinguished by the timer), and
/// the maximum duration that can be represented by a `Sleep` future (which is
/// limited by the size of a 64-bit integer).
///
/// A longer tick duration will allow represented longer sleeps, as the maximum
/// allowable sleep is the timer's granularity multiplied by [`u64::MAX`]. A
/// shorter tick duration will allow for more precise sleeps at the expense of
/// reducing the maximum allowed sleep.
///
/// When using an [interrupt-driven time source](#interrupt-driven-timers), the
/// tick duration should generally be the interval that the timer interrupt
/// fires at. A finer resolution won't have any benefit, as the timer only fires
/// at that frequency, and all sleeps that complete between two timer interrupts
/// will be woken at the same time anyway.
///
/// When using a [timestamp-driven time source](#timestamp-driven-timers),
/// selecting the resolution of the timestamp counter as the timer's tick
/// duration is probably a good choice.
