/// implement structures like "async mailboxes", where an async function
/// requests some data (such as a response) associated with a certain
/// key (such as a message ID). When the data is received, the key can
/// be used to provide the task with the desired data, as well as wake
/// the task for further processing.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Waking a single task at a time by calling [`wake`][wake]:
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use maitake::{scheduler::Scheduler, wait::map::{WaitMap, WakeOutcome}};

///
/// // In order to spawn tasks, we need a `Scheduler` instance.

/// // Spawn some tasks that will wait on the queue.
/// // We'll use the task index (0..10) as the key.
/// for i in 0..TASKS {
///     let q = q.clone();
///     scheduler.spawn(async move {
///         let val = q.wait(i).await.unwrap();

/// // No tasks should complete on this tick, as they are all waiting
/// // to be woken by the queue.
/// assert_eq!(tick.completed, 0, "no tasks have been woken");

/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// The *[intrusive]* aspect of this map is important, as it means that it does
/// not allocate memory. Instead, nodes in the linked list are stored in the
/// futures of tasks trying to wait for capacity. This means that it is not
/// necessary to allocate any heap memory for each task waiting to be woken.
///
/// However, the intrusive linked list introduces one new danger: because
/// futures can be *cancelled*, and the linked list nodes live within the
/// futures trying to wait on the queue, we *must* ensure that the node
/// is unlinked from the list before dropping a cancelled future. Failure to do
/// so would result in the list containing dangling pointers. Therefore, we must
/// use a *doubly-linked* list, so that nodes can edit both the previous and
/// next node when they have to remove themselves. This is kind of a bummer, as
/// it means we can't use something nice like this [intrusive queue by Dmitry
/// Vyukov][2], and there are not really practical designs for lock-free
/// doubly-linked lists that don't rely on some kind of deferred reclamation
/// scheme such as hazard pointers or QSBR.
///
/// Instead, we just stick a [`Mutex`] around the linked list, which must be
/// acquired to pop nodes from it, or for nodes to remove themselves when
/// futures are cancelled. This is a bit sad, but the critical sections for this
/// mutex are short enough that we still get pretty good performance despite it.
