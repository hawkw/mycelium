/// An asynchronous [counting semaphore].
///
/// A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that limits the number of tasks
/// that may run concurrently. It consists of a count of _permits_, which tasks
/// may [`acquire`] in order to execute in some context. When a task acquires a
/// permit from the semaphore, the count of permits held by the semaphore is
/// decreased. When no permits remain in the semaphore, any task that wishes to
/// acquire a permit must (asynchronously) wait until another task has released
/// a permit.
///
/// The [`Permit`] type is a RAII guard representing one or more permits
/// acquired from a `Semaphore`. When a [`Permit`] is dropped, the permits it
/// represents are released back to the `Semaphore`, potentially allowing a
/// waiting task to acquire them.
///
/// # Fairness
///
/// This semaphore is _fair_: as permits become available, they are assigned to
/// waiting tasks in the order that those tasks requested permits (first-in,
/// first-out). This means that all tasks waiting to acquire permits will
/// eventually be allowed to progress, and a single task cannot starve the
/// semaphore of permits (provided that permits are eventually released). The
/// semaphore remains fair even when a call to `acquire` requests more than one
/// permit at a time.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Using a semaphore to limit concurrency:
///
/// ```
/// # use std as alloc;
/// use maitake::{scheduler::Scheduler, wait::Semaphore};
/// use alloc::sync::Arc;
///
/// let scheduler = Scheduler::new();
/// // Allow 4 tasks to run concurrently at a time.
/// let semaphore = Arc::new(Semaphore::new(4));
///
/// for _ in 0..8 {
///     // Clone the `Arc` around the semaphore.
///     let semaphore = semaphore.clone();
///     scheduler.spawn(async move {
///         // Acquire a permit from the semaphore, returning a RAII guard that
///         // releases the permit back to the semaphore when dropped.
///         //
///         // If all 4 permits have been acquired, the calling task will yield,
///         // and it will be woken when another task releases a permit.
///         let _permit = semaphore
///             .acquire(1)
///             .await
///             .expect("semaphore will not be closed");
///
///         // do some work...
///     });
/// }
///
/// scheduler.tick();
/// ```
///
/// A semaphore may also be used to cause a task to run once all of a set of
/// tasks have completed. If we want some task _B_ to run only after a fixed
/// number _n_ of tasks _A_ have run, we can have task _B_ try to acquire _n_
/// permits from a semaphore with 0 permits, and have each task _A_ add one
/// permit to the semaphore when it completes.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// # use std as alloc;
/// use maitake::{scheduler::Scheduler, wait::Semaphore};
/// use alloc::sync::Arc;
///
/// // How many tasks will we be waiting for the completion of?
/// const TASKS: usize = 4;
///
/// let scheduler = Scheduler::new();
///
/// // Create the semaphore with 0 permits.
/// let semaphore = Arc::new(Semaphore::new(0));
///
/// // Spawn the "B" task that will wait for the 4 "A" tasks to complete.
/// scheduler.spawn({
///     let semaphore = semaphore.clone();
///     async move {
///         println!("Task B starting...");
///
///         // Since the semaphore is created with 0 permits, this will
///         // wait until all 4 "A" tasks have completed.
///        let _permit = semaphore
///             .acquire(TASKS)
///             .await
///             .expect("semaphore will not be closed");
///
///         // ... do some work ...
///
///         println!("Task B done!");
///     }
/// });
///
/// for i in 0..TASKS {
///     let semaphore = semaphore.clone();
///     scheduler.spawn(async move {
///         println!("Task A {i} starting...");
///
///         // Add a single permit to the semaphore. Once all 4 tasks have
///         // completed, the semaphore will have the 4 permits required to
///         // wake the "B" task.
///         semaphore.add_permits(1);
///
///         // ... do some work ...
