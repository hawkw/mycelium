//! Schedulers for executing [tasks][task].
//!
//! In order to execute [asynchronous tasks][task], a system must have one or
//! more _schedulers_. A scheduler (also sometimes referred to as an
//! _executor_) is a component responsible for tracking which tasks have been
//! [woken], and [polling] them when they are ready to make progress.
//!
//! This module contains scheduler implementations for use with the [`maitake`
//! task system][task].
//!
//! # Using Schedulers
//!
//! This module provides two types which can be used as schedulers. These types
//! differ based on how the core data of the scheduler is shared with tasks
//! spawned on that scheduler:
//!
//! - [`Scheduler`]: a reference-counted single-core scheduler (requires the
//!       "alloc" [feature]). A [`Scheduler`] is internally implemented using an
//!       [`Arc`], and each task spawned on a [`Scheduler`] holds an `Arc` clone
//!       of the scheduler core.
//! - [`StaticScheduler`]: a single-core scheduler stored in a `static`
//!       variable. A [`StaticScheduler`] is referenced by tasks spawned on it
//!       as an `&'static StaticScheduler` reference. Therefore, it can be used
//!       without requiring `alloc`, and avoids atomic reference count
//!       increments when spawning tasks. However, in order to be used, a
//!       [`StaticScheduler`] *must* be stored in a `'static`, which can limit
//!       its usage in some cases.
//!
//! The [`Schedule`] trait in this module is used by the [`Task`] type to
//! abstract over both types of scheduler that tasks may be spawned on.
//!
//! ## Spawning Tasks
//!
//! Once a scheduler has been constructed, tasks may be spawned on it using the
//! [`Scheduler::spawn`] or [`StaticScheduler::spawn`] methods. These methods
//! allocate a [new `Box` to store the spawned task](task::BoxStorage), and
//! therefore require the ["alloc" feature][feature].
//!
//! Alternatively, if [custom task storage](task::Storage) is in use, the
//! scheduler types also provide [`Scheduler::spawn_allocated`] and
//! [`StaticScheduler::spawn_allocated`] methods, which allow spawning a task
//! that has already been stored in a type implementing the [`task::Storage`]
//! trait. This can be used *without* the "alloc" feature flag, and is primarily
//! intended for use in systems where tasks are statically allocated, or where
//! an alternative allocator API (rather than `liballoc`) is in use.
//!
//! Finally, to configure the properties of a task prior to spawning it, both
//! scheduler types provide [`Scheduler::build_task`] and
//! [`StaticScheduler::build_task`] methods. These methods return a
//! [`task::Builder`] struct, which can be used to set properties of a task and
//! then spawn it on that scheduler.
//!
//! ## Executing Tasks
//!
//! In order to actually execute the tasks spawned on a scheduler, the scheduler
//! must be _driven_ by dequeueing tasks from its run queue and polling them.
//!
//! Because [`maitake` is a low-level async runtime "construction kit"][kit]
//! rather than a complete runtime implementation, the interface for driving a
//! scheduler is tick-based. A _tick_ refers to an iteration of a
//! scheduler's run loop, in which a set of tasks are dequeued from the
//! scheduler's run queue and polled. Calling the [`Scheduler::tick`] or
//! [`StaticScheduler::tick`] method on a  scheduler runs that scheduler for a
//! single tick, returning a [`Tick`] struct with data describing the events
//! that occurred during that tick.
//!
//! The scheduler API is tick-based, rather than providing methods that
//! continuously tick the scheduler until all tasks have completed, because
//! ticking a scheduler is often only one step of a system's run loop. A
//! scheduler is responsible for polling the tasks that have been woken, but it
//! does *not* wake tasks which are waiting for other runtime services, such as
//! timers and I/O resources.
//!
//! Typically, an iteration of a system's run loop consists of the following steps:
//!
//! - **Tick the scheduler**, executing any tasks that have been woken,
//! - **Tick a [timer][^1]**, to advance the system clock and wake any tasks waiting
//!   for time-based events,
//! - **Process wakeups from I/O resources**, such as hardware interrupts that
//!   occurred during the tick. The component responsible for this is often
//!   referred to as an [I/O reactor].
//! - Optionally, **spawn tasks from external sources**, such as work-stealing
//!   tasks from other schedulers, or receiving tasks from a remote system.
//!
//! The implementation of the timer and I/O runtime services in a bare-metal
//! system typically depend on details of the hardware platform in use.
//! Therefore, `maitake` does not provide a batteries-included runtime that
//! bundles together a scheduler, timer, and I/O reactor. Instead, the
//! lower-level tick-based scheduler interface allows running a `maitake`
//! scheduler as part of a run loop implementation that also drives other parts
//! of the runtime.
//!
//! A single call to [`Scheduler::tick`] will dequeue and poll up to
//! [`Scheduler::DEFAULT_TICK_SIZE`] tasks from the run queue, rather than
//! looping until all tasks in the queue have been dequeued.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! A simple implementation of a system's run loop might look like this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use maitake::scheduler::Scheduler;
//!
//! /// Process any time-based events that have occurred since this function
//! /// was last called.
//! fn process_timeouts() {
//!     // this might tick a `maitake::time::Timer` or run some other form of
//!     // time driver implementation.
//! }
//!
//!
//! /// Process any I/O events that have occurred since this function
//! /// was last called.
//! fn process_io_events() {
//!     // this function would handle dispatching any I/O interrupts that
//!     // occurred during the tick to tasks that are waiting for those I/O
//!     // events.
//! }
//!
//! /// Put the system into a low-power state until a hardware interrupt
//! /// occurs.
//! fn wait_for_interrupts() {
//!     // the implementation of this function would, of course, depend on the
//!     // hardware platform in use...
//! }
//!
//! /// The system's main run loop.
//! fn run_loop() {
//!     let scheduler = Scheduler::new();
//!
//!     loop {
//!         // process time-based events
//!         process_timeouts();
//!
//!         // process I/O events
//!         process_io_events();
//!
//!         // tick the scheduler, running any tasks woken by processing time
//!         // and I/O events, as well as tasks woken by other tasks during the
//!         // tick.
//!         let tick = scheduler.tick();
//!
//!         if !tick.has_remaining {
//!             // if the scheduler's run queue is empty, wait for an interrupt
//!             // to occur before ticking the scheduler again.
//!             wait_for_interrupts();
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [^1]: The [`maitake::time`](crate::time) module provides one
//!     [`Timer`](crate::time::Timer) implementation, but other timers could be
//!     used as well.

/// A statically-initialized scheduler implementation.
///
/// This type stores the core of the scheduler behind an `&'static` reference,
/// which is passed into each task spawned on the scheduler. This means that, in
/// order to spawn tasks, the `StaticScheduler` *must* be stored in a `static`
/// variable.
///
/// The use of a `&'static` reference allows `StaticScheduler`s to be used
/// without `liballoc`. In addition, spawning and deallocating tasks is slightly
/// cheaper than when using the reference-counted [`Scheduler`] type, because an
/// atomic reference count increment/decrement is not required.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// A `StaticScheduler` may be created one of two ways, depending on how the
/// [stub task] used by the MPSC queue algorithm is created: either with a
/// statically-allocated stub task by using the
/// [`StaticScheduler::new_with_static_stub`] function, or with a heap-allocated
/// stub task using [`StaticScheduler::new`] or [`StaticScheduler::default`]
/// (which require the ["alloc" feature][features]).
///
/// The [`new_with_static_stub`] function is a `const fn`, which allows a
/// `StaticScheduler` to be constructed directly in a `static` initializer.
/// However, it requires the [`TaskStub`] to be constructed manually by the
/// caller and passed in to initialize the scheduler. Furthermore, this function
/// is `unsafe` to call, as it requires that the provided [`TaskStub`] *not* be
/// used by any other `StaticScheduler` instance, which the function cannot
/// ensure.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```rust
/// use maitake::scheduler::{self, StaticScheduler};
///
/// static SCHEDULER: StaticScheduler = {
///     // create a new static stub task *inside* the initializer for the
///     // `StaticScheduler`. since the stub task static cannot be referenced
///     // outside of this block, we can ensure that it is not used by any
///     // other calls to `StaticScheduler::new_with_static_stub`.
///     static STUB_TASK: scheduler::TaskStub = scheduler::TaskStub::new();
///
///     // now, create the scheduler itself:
///     unsafe {
///         // safety: creating the stub task inside the block used as an
///         // initializer expression for the scheduler static ensures that
///         // the stub task is not used by any other scheduler instance.
///         StaticScheduler::new_with_static_stub(&STUB_TASK)
///     }
/// };
///
/// // now, we can use the scheduler to spawn tasks:
/// SCHEDULER.spawn(async { /* ... */ });
/// ```
///
/// The [`scheduler::new_static!`] macro abstracts over the above code, allowing
/// a `static StaticScheduler` to be initialized without requiring the caller to
/// manually write `unsafe` code:
///
/// ```rust
/// use maitake::scheduler::{self, StaticScheduler};
///
/// // this macro expands to code identical to the previous example.
/// static SCHEDULER: StaticScheduler = scheduler::new_static!();
///
/// // now, we can use the scheduler to spawn tasks:
/// SCHEDULER.spawn(async { /* ... */ });
/// ```
///
/// Alternatively, the [`new`] and [`default`] constructors can be used to
/// create a new `StaticScheduler` with a heap-allocated stub task. This does
/// not require the user to manually create a stub task and ensure that it is
/// not used by any other `StaticScheduler` instances. However, these
/// constructors are not `const fn`s and require the ["alloc" feature][features]
/// to be enabled.
///
/// Because [`StaticScheduler::new`] and [`StaticScheduler::default`] are not
/// `const fn`s, but the scheduler must still be stored in a `static` to be
/// used, some form of lazy initialization of the `StaticScheduler` is necessary:
///
/// ```rust
/// use maitake::scheduler::StaticScheduler;
/// use mycelium_util::sync::Lazy;
///
/// static SCHEDULER: Lazy<StaticScheduler> = Lazy::new(StaticScheduler::new);
///
/// // now, we can use the scheduler to spawn tasks:
/// SCHEDULER.spawn(async { /* ... */ });
/// ```
///
/// Although the scheduler itself is no longer constructed in a `const fn`
/// static initializer in this case, storing it in a `static` rather than an
/// [`Arc`] still provides a minor performance benefit, as it avoids atomic
/// reference counting when spawning tasks.
