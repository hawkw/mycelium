//! Asynchronous synchronization primitives
//!
//! [_Synchronization primitives_][primitives] are tools for implementing
//! synchronization between [tasks]: to control which tasks can run at any given
//! time, and in what order, and to coordinate tasks' access to shared
//! resources. Typically, this synchronization involves some form of _waiting_.
//! In asynchronous systems, synchronization primitives allow tasks to wait by
//! yielding to the runtime scheduler, so that other tasks may run while they
//! are waiting. This module provides asynchronous implementations of common
//! synchronization primitives.
//!
//! The following synchronization primitives are provided:
//!
//! - [`Mutex`]: a fairly queued, asynchronous [mutual exclusion lock], for
//!       protecting shared data
//! - [`RwLock`]: a fairly queued, asynchronous [readers-writer lock], which
//!       allows concurrent read access to shared data while ensuring write
//!       access is exclusive
//! - [`Semaphore`]: an asynchronous [counting semaphore], for limiting the
//!       number of tasks which may run concurrently
//! - [`WaitCell`], a cell that stores a *single* waiting task's [`Waker`], so
//!       that the task can be woken by another task,
//! - [`WaitQueue`], a queue of waiting tasks, which are woken in first-in,
//!       first-out order
//! - [`WaitMap`], a set of waiting tasks associated with keys, in which a task
//!       can be woken by its key
//!
