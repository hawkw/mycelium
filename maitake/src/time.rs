//! Utilities for tracking time and constructing system timers.
//!
//! # Futures
//!
//! This module contains the following [`Future`]s:
//!
//! - [`Sleep`], a future which completes after a specified duration,
//! - [`Timeout`], which wraps another [`Future`] to limit the duration it can
//!   run for.
//!
//! # Timers
//!
//! The [`Sleep`] and [`Timeout`] futures do not complete on their own. Instead,
//! they must be driven by a [`Timer`], which tracks the current time and
//! notifies time-based futures when their deadlines are reached.
//!
//! The [`Timer`] struct implements a [hierarchical timer wheel][wheel], a data
//! structure for tracking large numbers of timers efficiently. It is used to
//! create [`Sleep`]s and [`Timeout`]s, and notify them when their deadlines
//! complete. In order to be used, a [`Timer`] must be driven by a hardware time
//! source. See [the `Timer` documentation][driving-timers] for more information
//! on using this type to implement a system timer.
//!
//! ### Global Timers
//!
//! In most cases, it is desirable to have a single global timer instance that
//! drives all time-based futures in the system. In particular, creating new
//! [`Sleep`] and [`Timeout`] futures typically requires a reference to a
//! [`Timer`] instance, which can be inconvenient to pass around to the points
//! in a system where [`Sleep`] and [`Timeout`] futures are created.
//!
//! Therefore, the `maitake` timer also includes support for setting a global
//! timer, using the [`set_global_timer`] function. Once a global timer
//! has been initialized, the [`sleep()`] and [`timeout()`] free functions in
//! this module can be used to create time-based futures without a reference to a
//! [`Timer`] instance. These functions will always create futures bound to the
//! global default timer.
//!
//! Note that a global default timer can only be set once. Subsequent calls to
//! [`set_global_timer`] after a global timer has been initialized will
//! return an error.
