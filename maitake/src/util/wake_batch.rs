/// This type is essentially an array of [`Waker`]s to which multiple tasks'
/// [`Waker`]s can be added, until the array fills up. Once the array is full,
/// all the tasks in the batch can be woken by calling [`WakeBatch::wake_all`],
/// and the array refilled with new tasks.
///
/// This is useful when a lock must be held to remove [`Waker`]s from a queue
/// (e.g. a [`cordyceps::List`]), but the lock can be released before the tasks
/// are actually woken. Doing this repeatedly, rather than holding the lock for
/// the entire wake process, may improve latency for other tasks that are
/// attempting to access the lock. Additionally, it may avoid deadlocks that
/// occur when a woken task will attempt to access the lock itself.
