## what is it?

This library is a collection of modular components for building a Rust
async runtime based on [`core::task`] and [`core::future`], with a focus on
supporting `#![no_std]` projects.

Unlike other async runtime implementations, `maitake` does *not* provide a
complete, fully-functional runtime implementation. Instead, it provides reusable
implementations of common functionality, including a [task system],
[scheduling], and [notification primitives][wait]. These components may be
combined with other runtime services, such as timers and I/O resources, to
produce a complete, application-specific async runtime.

`maitake` was initially designed for use in the [mycelium] and [mnemOS]
operating systems, but may be useful for other projects as well.

| Feature | Default | Explanation |
| :---    | :---    | :---        |
| `alloc` | `true`  | Enables [`liballoc`] dependency |
| `no-cache-pad` | `false` | Inhibits cache padding for the [`CachePadded`] struct. When this feature is NOT enabled, the size will be determined based on target platform. |
