## what is it?

This library is a collection of modular components for building a Rust
async runtime based on [`core::task`] and [`core::future`], with a focus on
supporting `#![no_std]` projects.

Unlike other async runtime implementations, `maitake` does *not* provide a
complete, fully-functional runtime implementation. Instead, it provides reusable
implementations of common functionality, including a [task system][task],
[scheduler], a [timer wheel][timer], and [synchronization primitives][sync].
These components may be combined with other runtime services, such as timers and
I/O resources, to produce a complete, application-specific async runtime.

`maitake` was initially designed for use in the [mycelium] and [mnemOS]
operating systems, but may be useful for other projects as well.

## a tour of `maitake`

`maitake` currently provides the following major API components:

- **[`maitake::task`][task]: the `maitake` task system**. This module contains the
  [`Task`] type, representing an asynchronous task (a [`Future`] that can be
  spawned on the runtime), and the [`TaskRef`] type, a reference-counted,
  type-erased pointer to a spawned [`Task`].

  Additionally, it also contains other utility types for working with tasks.
  These include the [`JoinHandle`] type, which can be used to await the output
  of a task once it has been spawned, and the [`task::Builder`] type, for
  configuring a task prior to spawning it.

- **[`maitake::scheduler`][scheduler]: schedulers for executing tasks**. In order to
  actually execute asynchronous tasks, one or more schedulers is required. This
  module contains the [`Scheduler`] and [`StaticScheduler`] types, which
  implement task schedulers, and utilities for constructing and using
  schedulers.

- **[`maitake::time`][time]: timers and futures for tracking time**. This module
  contains tools for waiting for time-based events in asynchronous systems. It
  provides the [`Sleep`] type, a [`Future`] which completes after a specified
  duration, and the [`Timeout`] type, which wraps another [`Future`] and cancels
  it if it runs for longer than a specified duration without completing.

  In order to use these futures, a system must have a timer. The `maitake::time`
  module therefore provides the [`Timer`] type, a hierarchical timer wheel which
  can track and notify a large number of time-based futures efficiently. A
  [`Timer`] must be [driven by a hardware time source][time-source], such as an
  interrupt or timestamp counter.

- **[`maitake::sync`][sync]: asynchronous synchronization primitives**. This
  module provides asynchronous implementations of common [synchronization
  primitives], including a [`Mutex`], [`RwLock`], and [`Semaphore`].
  Additionally, it provides lower-level synchronization types which may be
  useful when implementing custom synchronization strategies.

- **[`maitake::future`][future]: utility futures**. This module provides
  general-purpose utility [`Future`] types that may be used without the Rust
  standard library.

## usage considerations

`maitake` is intended primarily for use in bare-metal projects, such as
operating systems, operating system components, and embedded systems. These
bare-metal systems typically do not use the Rust standard library, so `maitake`
supports `#![no_std]` by default, and the use of [`liballoc`] is feature-flagged
for systems where [`liballoc`] is unavailable.

This intended use case has some important implications:

#### `maitake` is *not* a complete asynchronous runtime

This is in contrast to other async runtimes, like [`tokio`], [`async-std`], and
[`glommio`], which provide everything a userspace application needs to run
async tasks and perform asynchronous IO, with lower-level implementation
details encapsulated behind the runtime's API. In the bare-metal systems
`maitake` is intended for use in, however, it is often necessary to have more
direct control over lower-level implementation details of the runtime.

For example: in an asynchronous runtime, [tasks] must be stored in non-stack
memory. Runtimes like [`tokio`] and [`async-std`] use the standard library's
allocator and `Box` type to allocate tasks on the heap. In bare-metal systems,
though, [`liballoc`]'s heap allocator may not be available. Such a system may
have no ability to perform dynamic heap allocations, or may implement its own
allocator which may not be compatible with `liballoc`.

`maitake` is designed to still be usable in those cases &mdash; even a system
which cannot dynamically allocate memory could use `maitake` in order to
create and schedule a fixed set of tasks that are stored in `'static`s, essentially
allocating tasks at compile-time. Therefore, `maitake` provides [an
interface][Storage] for overriding the memory container in which tasks are
stored. In order to provide such an interface, however, `maitake` must expose
[the in-memory representation of spawned tasks][Task], which other runtimes
typically do not make part of their public APIs.

#### `maitake` does not support unwinding

Rust supports multiple modes of handling [panics]: `panic="abort"` and
`panic="unwind"`. When a program is compiled with `panic="unwind"`, panics are
handled by [unwinding] the stack of the panicking thread. This allows the use of
APIs like [`catch_unwind`], which allows panics to be handled without
terminating the entire program. On the other hand, compiling with
`panic="abort"` means that all panics immediately terminate the program.

Bare-metal systems typically do not use stack unwinding. For programs which use
the Rust standard library, support for unwinding is provided by `std`. However,
in bare-metal, `#![no_std]` systems, it is necessary for the system to implement
its own unwinding system. Therefore, *`maitake` does not support unwinding*.

This is important to note, because supporting unwinding imposes additional
[safety considerations][UnwindSafe]. In order to safely support unwinding, many
parts of `maitake`, such as runtime internals and synchronization primitives,
would have to take extra steps to ensure that they cannot be left in an invalid
state during unwinding. Ensuring unwind-safety would require the use of standard
library APIs that are not available without `std`, so `maitake` does not ensure
unwind-safety.

This means that `maitake` **should not be used** in programs compiled with
`panic="unwind"`. Typically, no bare-metal program will fall into this category,
but if you are using `maitake` in a project which uses `std`, it is necessary to
explicitly disable unwinding in that project's `Cargo.toml`.

## platform support

In general, `maitake` is a platform-agnostic library. It does not interact
directly with the underlying hardware, or use platform-specific features (with
one small exception). Instead, `maitake` provides portable implementations of
core runtime components. In some cases, [such as the timer wheel][time-source],
downstream code must integrate `maitake`'s APIs with hardware-specific code for
in order to use them effectively.

### support for atomic operations

However, one aspect of `maitake`'s implementation may differ slightly across
different target architectures: `maitake` relies on atomic operations integers.
Sometimes, atomic operations on integers of specific widths are needed (e.g.,
[`AtomicU64`]), which may not be available on all architectures.

In order to work on architectures which lack atomic operations on 64-bit
integers, `maitake` uses the [`portable-atomic`] crate by Taiki Endo. This crate
crate polyfills atomic operations on integers larger than the platform's pointer
width, when these are not supported in hardware.

In most cases, users of `maitake` don't need to be aware of `maitake`'s use of
`portable-atomic`. If compiling `maitake` for a target architecture that has
native support for 64-bit atomic operations (such as `x86_64` or `aarch64`), the
native atomics are used automatically. Similarly, if compiling `maitake` for any
target that has atomic compare-and-swap operations on any size integer, but
lacks 64-bit atomics (i.e., 32-bit x86 targets like `i686`, or 32-bit ARM
targets with atomic operations), the `portable-atomic` polyfill is used
automatically. Finally, when compiling for target architectures which lack
atomic operations because they are *always* single-core, such as MSP430 or AVR
microcontrollers, `portable-atomic` simply uses unsynchronized operations with
interrupts temporarily disabled.

**The only case where the user must be aware of `portable-atomic` is when
compiling for targets which lack atomic operations but are not guaranteed to
always be single-core**. This includes ARMv6-M (`thumbv6m`), pre-v6 ARM (e.g.,
`thumbv4t`, `thumbv5te`), and RISC-V targets without the A extension. On these
architectures, the user must manually enable the [`RUSTFLAGS`] configuration
[`--cfg portable_atomic_unsafe_assume_single_core`][single-core] if (and **only
if**) the specific target hardware is known to be single-core. Enabling this cfg
is unsafe, as it will cause unsound behavior on multi-core systems using these
architectures.

Additional configurations for some single-core systems, which determine the
specific sets of interrupts that `portable-atomic` will disable when entering a
critical section, are described [here][interrupt-cfgs].
