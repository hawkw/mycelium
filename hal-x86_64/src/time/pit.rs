/// Intel 8253/8254 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT).
///
/// The PIT is a simple timer, with three channels. The most interesting is
/// channel 0, which is capable of firing an interrupt to the [8259 PIC] or [I/O
/// APIC] on ISA interrupt vector 0. Channel 1 was used to time the DRAM refresh
/// rate on ancient IBM PCs and is now generally unused (and may not be
/// implemented in hardware), and channel 2 was connected to the IBM PC speaker
/// and could be used to play sounds.
///
/// The PIT has a non-configurable [base frequency] of 1.193182 MHz, for
/// [extremely cool reasons][reasons], but a 16-bit divisor can be used to
/// determine what multiple of this base frequency each channel fires at.

    /// generates an IRQ 0. Typically during boot the BIOS sets channel 0 with
    /// a count of 65535 or 0 (which translates to 65536), which gives an output
    /// frequency of 18.2065 Hz (or an IRQ every 54.9254 ms). Channel 0 is
    /// probably the most useful PIT channel, as it is the only channel that is
    /// connected to an IRQ. It can be used to generate an infinte series of
    /// "timer ticks" at a frequency of your choice (as long as it is higher
    /// than 18 Hz), or to generate single CPU interrupts (in "one shot" mode)
    /// after programmable short delays (less than an 18th of a second).
    ///

    /// code, rather than for general purpose use in an operating system.

    /// In particular, using this function is subject to the following
    /// considerations:
    ///
    /// - An interrupt handler for the PIT interrupt which clears the sleeping flag
    ///   must be installed. This is done automatically by the [`Controller::init`]
    ///   function in the [`interrupt`] module. If that interrupt handler is not
    ///   present, this function will spin forever!
    /// - If the PIT is currently in periodic mode, it will be put in oneshot mode
    ///   when this function is called. This will temporarily disable the existing
    ///   periodic timer.
    /// - This function returns an error if another CPU core is already sleeping. It
    ///   should generally be used only prior to the initialization of application
    ///   processors.
    ///
    /// # Returns
