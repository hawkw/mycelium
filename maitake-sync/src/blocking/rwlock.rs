/// A spinlock-based [readers-writer lock].
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any
/// point in time. The write portion of this lock typically allows modification
/// of the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock
/// typically allows for read-only access (shared access).
///
/// In comparison, a [`spin::Mutex`] does not distinguish between readers or writers
/// that acquire the lock, therefore blocking any threads waiting for the lock to
/// become available. An `RwLock` will allow any number of readers to acquire the
/// lock as long as a writer is not holding the lock.
///
/// # Fairness
///
/// This is *not* a fair reader-writer lock.
///
/// # Loom-specific behavior
///
/// When `cfg(loom)` is enabled, this mutex will use Loom's simulated atomics,
/// checked `UnsafeCell`, and simulated spin loop hints.
