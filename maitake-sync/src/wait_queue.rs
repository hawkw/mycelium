/// A queue of waiting tasks which can be [woken in first-in, first-out
/// order][wake], or [all at once][wake_all].
///
/// A `WaitQueue` allows any number of tasks to [wait] asynchronously and be
/// woken when some event occurs, either [individually][wake] in first-in,
/// first-out order, or [all at once][wake_all]. This makes it a vital building
/// block of runtime services (such as timers or I/O resources), where it may be
/// used to wake a set of tasks when a timer completes or when a resource
/// becomes available. It can be equally useful for implementing higher-level
/// synchronization primitives: for example, a `WaitQueue` plus an
/// [`UnsafeCell`] is essentially [an entire implementation of a fair
/// asynchronous mutex][mutex]. Finally, a `WaitQueue` can be a useful
/// synchronization primitive on its own: sometimes, you just need to have a
/// bunch of tasks wait for something and then wake them all up.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Waking a single task at a time by calling [`wake`][wake]:
///
/// ```ignore
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use maitake::scheduler::Scheduler;
/// use maitake_sync::WaitQueue;
///
/// const TASKS: usize = 10;
///
/// // In order to spawn tasks, we need a `Scheduler` instance.
/// let scheduler = Scheduler::new();
///
/// // Construct a new `WaitQueue`.
/// let q = Arc::new(WaitQueue::new());
///
/// // Spawn some tasks that will wait on the queue.
/// for _ in 0..TASKS {
///     let q = q.clone();
///     scheduler.spawn(async move {
///         // Wait to be woken by the queue.
///         q.wait().await.expect("queue is not closed");
///     });
/// }
///
/// // Tick the scheduler once.
/// let tick = scheduler.tick();
///
/// // No tasks should complete on this tick, as they are all waiting
/// // to be woken by the queue.
/// assert_eq!(tick.completed, 0, "no tasks have been woken");
///
/// let mut completed = 0;
/// for i in 1..=TASKS {
///     // Wake the next task from the queue.
///     q.wake();
///
///     // Tick the scheduler.
///     let tick = scheduler.tick();
///
///     // A single task should have completed on this tick.
///     completed += tick.completed;
///     assert_eq!(completed, i);
/// }
///
/// assert_eq!(completed, TASKS, "all tasks should have completed");
/// ```
///
/// Waking all tasks using [`wake_all`][wake_all]:
///

///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// This type is implemented using an [intrusive doubly-linked list][ilist].
///
/// The *[intrusive]* aspect of this list is important, as it means that it does
/// not allocate memory. Instead, nodes in the linked list are stored in the
/// futures of tasks trying to wait for capacity. This means that it is not
/// necessary to allocate any heap memory for each task waiting to be woken.
///
/// However, the intrusive linked list introduces one new danger: because
/// futures can be *cancelled*, and the linked list nodes live within the
/// futures trying to wait on the queue, we *must* ensure that the node
/// is unlinked from the list before dropping a cancelled future. Failure to do
/// so would result in the list containing dangling pointers. Therefore, we must
/// use a *doubly-linked* list, so that nodes can edit both the previous and
/// next node when they have to remove themselves. This is kind of a bummer, as
/// it means we can't use something nice like this [intrusive queue by Dmitry
/// Vyukov][2], and there are not really practical designs for lock-free
/// doubly-linked lists that don't rely on some kind of deferred reclamation
/// scheme such as hazard pointers or QSBR.
///
/// Instead, we just stick a [`Mutex`] around the linked list, which must be
/// acquired to pop nodes from it, or for nodes to remove themselves when
/// futures are cancelled. This is a bit sad, but the critical sections for this
/// mutex are short enough that we still get pretty good performance despite it.
