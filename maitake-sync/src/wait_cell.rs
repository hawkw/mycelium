/// An atomically registered [`Waker`].
///
/// This cell stores the [`Waker`] of a single task. A [`Waker`] is stored in
/// the cell either by calling [`poll_wait`], or by polling a [`wait`]
/// future. Once a task's [`Waker`] is stored in a `WaitCell`, it can be woken
/// by calling [`wake`] on the `WaitCell`.
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// This is inspired by the [`AtomicWaker`] type used in Tokio's
/// synchronization primitives, with the following modifications:
///
/// - An additional bit of state is added to allow [setting a "close"
///   bit](Self::close).
/// - A `WaitCell` is always woken by value (for now).
/// - `WaitCell` does not handle unwinding, because [`maitake` does not support
///   unwinding](crate#maitake-does-not-support-unwinding)
///
