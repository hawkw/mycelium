/// An [intrusive] lock-free singly-linked FIFO stack, where all entries
/// currently in the stack are consumed in a single atomic operation.
///
/// A transfer stack is perhaps the world's simplest lock-free concurrent data
/// structure. It provides two primary operations:
///
/// - [`TransferStack::push`], which appends an element to the end of the
///   transfer stack,
///
/// - [`TransferStack::take_all`], which atomically takes all elements currently
///   on the transfer stack and returns them as a new mutable [`Stack`].
///
/// These are both *O*(1) operations, although `push` performs a
/// compare-and-swap loop that may be retried if another producer concurrently
/// pushed an element.
///
/// In order to be part of a `TransferStack`, a type `T` must implement
/// the [`Linked`] trait for [`stack::Links<T>`](Links).
///
/// Pushing elements into a `TransferStack` takes ownership of those elements
/// through an owning [`Handle` type](Linked::Handle). Dropping a
/// [`TransferStack`] drops all elements currently linked into the stack.
///
/// A transfer stack is often useful in cases where a large number of resources
/// must be efficiently transferred from several producers to a consumer, such
/// as for reuse or cleanup. For example, a [`TransferStack`] can be used as the
/// "thread" (shared) free list in a [`mimalloc`-style sharded
/// allocator][mimalloc], with a mutable [`Stack`] used as the local
/// (unsynchronized) free list. When an allocation is freed from the same CPU
/// core that it was allocated on, it is pushed to the local free list, using an
/// unsynchronized mutable [`Stack::push`] operation. If an allocation is freed
/// from a different thread, it is instead pushed to that thread's shared free
/// list, a [`TransferStack`], using an atomic [`TransferStack::push`]
/// operation. New allocations are popped from the local unsynchronized free
/// list, and if the local free list is empty, the entire shared free list is
/// moved onto the local free list. This allows objects which do not leave the
/// CPU core they were allocated on to be both allocated and deallocated using
/// unsynchronized operations, and new allocations only perform an atomic
/// operation when the local free list is empty.
