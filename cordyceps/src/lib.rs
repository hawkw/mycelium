/// Trait implemented by types which can be members of an [intrusive collection].
///
/// In order to be part of an intrusive collection, a type must contain a
/// `Links` type that stores the pointers to other nodes in that collection. For
/// example, to be part of a [doubly-linked list], a type must contain the
/// [`list::Links`] struct, or to be part of a [MPSC queue], a type must contain
/// the [`mpsc_queue::Links`] struct.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This is unsafe to implement because it's the implementation's responsibility
/// to ensure that types implementing this trait are valid intrusive collection
/// nodes. In particular:
///
/// - Implementations **must** ensure that implementorss are pinned in memory while they
///   are in an intrusive collection. While a given `Linked` type is in an intrusive
///   data structure, it may not be deallocated or moved to a different memory
///   location.
/// - The type implementing this trait **must not** implement [`Unpin`].
/// - Additional safety requirements for individual methods on this trait are
///   documented on those methods.
///
/// Failure to uphold these invariants will result in corruption of the
/// intrusive data structure, including dangling pointers.
///
